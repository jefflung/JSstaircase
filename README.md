Solution:
```
function staircase(n){
  for(let i = 0; i < n ; i++){
    const line = Array(i+1)
    .fill('#')
    .join('')
    .padStart(n);
    console.log(line);
  }
}
console.log(staircase(6)); //Test 6 rows
```
Explanation:
The result will be six times output of the function as I test with variable 6. The Array syntax set the length of # with fill and join sytax, 
and padStart determine # starts from end of the row.
